<h1>Rhea Ramakrishnan</h1>

      <p>
      I am a writer and maker based in Baltimore, MD. 
      My poems and short fiction have appeared in a few different lit journals and zines as well as self-published in collaborative
      blogs such as <a href="https://canitextu.wordpress.com/author/rhearamakrishnan/">Can I Text U</a> and 
      <a href="https://forblownspeakers.wordpress.com/author/rhearamakrishnan/">For Blown Speakers</a>. 
      I believe that we as humans are innately creative and that art and innovation should be accessible to everyone. 
      I am always interested in creating stuff with other people.
